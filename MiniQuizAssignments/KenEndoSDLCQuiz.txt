1-What is a disadvantage to the waterfall model
- The more time spent early in the software production cycle can increase costs at later stages
- Places emphasis on documentation as well as source code.
- provide an unstructured approach
- (correct)Client may not know exactly what their requirements are before they see working software and so change their requirement, leading to redesign, redevelopment, and retesting.

2-Why is spiral model called meta model?
- It provides informational data of the project
- It is a unique model that is independent of other models
- (correct)It subsumes all the other SDLC models
- It is part of the waterfall model

3-What is the benefit of user story?
- gives the template to the whole project
- (correct)This template serves as “training wheels”, reminding people in conversation about user stories to 
pay attention not just to “what” the desired software product is to do, but also “for whom” it does it and in pursuit of “what objectives”.
- the basis of a sprint
- fundamental template used in every model for SDLC, gives team an idea of what clients want.

4-What is a backlog in agile development
- The time frame in which the work must be completed
- the team discusses top priority user stories and decides what can be delivered in the sprint
- (correct) A list of set tasks that must be completed before the product is released
- record of all the task done daily

5-What is a blocker in agile development
- (correct) Anything that stops or slows down the delivery of a product, or acts as a hurdle for the
product
- Someone who makes usre that each user stories are done executed correctly.
- The practice of merging all developers working copies to a shared master several times a day.
- Deliberately blocking anothers code path to slow its progress.
